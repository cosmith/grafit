=========================================================================================

Grafit is a Chrome extension that lets you graph things on any webpage.

Just right-click on the number that you want to graph, click on the grafit context menu item
and watch its evolution unfold.

It is useful when you want to monitor progress on a certain task you're doing, or when you want to know 
the evolution of your reddit or HN karma in real time, if you want a popup with a particular stock's
information, or whatever else you want to plot over time!
